    "This chapter provides answers to most of the exercises. Note that it is useless to look up answers to exercises if you have not spent a significant amount of time trying to solve the exercises. You can only learn programming by doing. Only use the answers to compare them with your own, completed solutions, or as a final resort should you have no idea how to solve a problem. However, if you cannot solve a problem, it is usually better to re-do part of the notebooks that you evidently did not understand or forgot about. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that very often, the answers given here are only one of many possible ways to solve a problem. If you have found a different way to solve a problem, that might be just fine, though make sure you test your answer extensively to ensure that it is correct.\n",

    "Moreover, while the answers given here are usually efficient, efficiency is not the first goal when writing code. You should first make sure that your code solves the problem at hand, before you look into making the code more efficient.

    "A straightforward sorting procedure that first identifies the highest card, then the next highest card, then the lowest-but-one, and then the lowest card, needs six comparisons. You could perform it, for instance, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number the cards from 1 to 4, left to right. The number is tied to the spot where the card is, i.e., when you switch two cards, they exchange numbers. Compare cards 1 and 2, and switch them if 1 is higher than 2. Compare cards 2 and 3, and switch them if 2 is higher than 3. Compare cards 3 and 4, and switch them if 3 is higher than 4. Now the highest card will be the number 4. Then, compare cards 1 and 2 again, and switch them if 1 is higher than 2. Compare cards 2 and 3 again, and switch them if 2 is higher than 3. Now the next-highest card is number 3. Finally, compare cards 1 and 2 and switch them if 1 is higher than 2. You have now sorted the four cards, with six comparisons. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do it with less comparisons, you need a procedure that is a bit more complex. Start again by numbering the cards from 1 to 4. Compare cards 1 and 2, and switch them if 1 is higher than 2. Compare cards 3 and 4, and switch them if 3 is higher than 4. Compare cards 1 and 3. If 1 is higher than 3, you switch card 1 and 3, and also card 2 and 4. The lowest card is now in spot 1, and you also know that card 3 is lower than card 4. Now compare cards 2 and 3. If 2 is lower than 3, you are done, needing only four comparisons. If 2 is higher than 3, you switch 2 and 3. You now still have to compare cards 3 and 4, and switch them if 3 is higher than 4, but then you are done, needing only five comparisons. So you can do the sorting with a guaranteed maximum of five comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think that you can be smart and, after comparing 1 and 2 and maybe switching them, and comparing 3 and 4 and maybe switching them, to compare 2 and 3, because if at that point 2 is smaller than 3, you are done with the sorting needing only three comparisons. However, should at that point 2 be higher than 3, if you are unlucky you will need six comparisons in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those new to programming, the more efficient procedure which only needs five comparisons is quite hard to design, so do not get discouraged if you cannot come up with it. It is more important that you solve a task, than that you solve it in the most efficient manner."

    "There is a small trick in this code to speed up the calculation enormously. The code only tests dividers up to the square root of `num` (i.e., it tests up to the point that `i*i > num`). The reason that it does this, is that if there is a number bigger than the square root of `num` that divides it, there must necessarily also be one smaller than that square root. For instance, if the number is 21, the square root is between 4 and 5. So the algorithm only tests numbers up to 4. There is a divider for 21 higher than 4, namely 7. But that means there must also be one lower than (or equal to) 4, and indeed, there is one, namely 3. This is a gigantic speedup compared to testing all numbers up to `num`; for instance, if `num` is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 million, and is prime, you would need to test about 1 million numbers if you test all of them up to `num`, while this particular algorithm would only test about one thousand.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you found this trick, great! If not, don't worry: as long as your code works, you are doing just fine. The hard part is getting the code to work in the first place. As long as you accomplish that, you are well under way to becoming a great programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final note on this code: you should test it extensively! It is very easy to go wrong on particular numbers. In this case, make sure you test a negative number, zero, 1 (which all three should be reported as not prime), 2 (which is the lowest prime number and the only even one), 3 (which is the lowest odd prime), several not-prime numbers, several prime numbers, and numbers which are the square of a prime. Even better, if you can write a `for` loop around your code that tests all numbers between, for instance, -10 and 100, then you are really doing an extensive test of your code."

    "The code tries to print the return value of the function `area_of_triangle()`, but since this function has no return value, it prints the word `None`. When you create a function of which you want to display the output, you can either print the output in the function and then call it without using the return value, or you let the function produce the output, return it, and print the return value of the function in your main program. Not both. By the way, in general it is preferable if functions do not do the printing themselves, because it makes them more generally usable (for instance, the function `area_of_triangle()`, if it just returns the area instead of printing it, you can not only use the function to print the area, but also use the area in calculations). If you do not understand the explanation given here, revisit Chapter 6."

    "The recursive function works as follows: It loops through all numbers on `intlist`. If the current number is equal to `total`, it has found a solution and returns a list which contains only that number. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with a copy of `intlist` from which the current number is removed, for a `total` which is reduced by the current number (e.g., if the current number is 3 and the total is 5, it removes 3 from the list and checks whether a total of 2 can be achieved with the remaining list, because then 5 could be achieved by adding 3 to the solution for the remaining list). If the recursive call returns a list that is not empty, a solution is found, so the current number is appended to the returned list, and the result is returned. Once all numbers have been processed and no solution was found, an empty list is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The solution to this problem tests all possible subsets until one is found that solves the problem, or all of them have been tested. You might wonder whether there are smarter solutions, considering the fact that the number of subset rises exponentially with the size of of the list. The answer is that there might be solutions which improve upon this one (for instance, I could take into account that if a number occurs multiple times on the list that some subsets occur multiple times and need only be tested once), but that for general lists of numbers, no algorithm is known that avoids having to process each and every subset if there is no solution. For those who know some complexity theory: the subset sum problem is \"NP-hard\"."

    "Many answers are possible. Probably the simplest one is to use a dictionary where the keys are tuples of writers' last and first names, and the values are lists of all the books of a writer. A book is a tuple consisting of title and location. To find all the books of a writer, use the writer's last and first name to find a list of his books. To find the location of a specific book of a writer, get the list of his books and find the book on that list, then get the corresponding location. You could choose to store the booklist also as a dictionary with a book's title as key, but writers usually do not write so many books that you need to do that. Of course, using names as keys is not a great idea as it is easy to make spelling mistakes, and book titles as keys would be even less useful, but these were the only identifying elements I described. I can't complain if you want to introduce easier and less ambiguous keys in such a data structure (but in general, you should divert to a database system to deal with libraries)."

    "Do not forget that in the `__add__()` and `__sub__()` methods you have to create a (deep) copy of the fruit basket, which you change and return. It is up to the programmer of the main program to decide whether he wants to actually change the fruit basket, or just wants to see what a changed version looks like. However, in `__iadd__()` and `__isub__()` you are actually supposed to change the fruit basket, and still return `self`. The rest of the class is pretty straightforward, as long as you take into account that you have to delete fruits when their number has dropped to zero or less. "

Still, if more elaborate strategies need to be implemented, `MemoryStrategy` is a good starting point.\n",

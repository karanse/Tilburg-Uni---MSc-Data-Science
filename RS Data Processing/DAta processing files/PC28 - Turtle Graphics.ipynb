    "Whenever people think of programming computers, they imagine cool graphics. Until now, this whole course was pretty much text-based. It is not that Python cannot be used to create graphics, it is just that for most graphics-heavy programs, different computer languages are used. However, it is definitely possible to create graphics with Python, from graphical user interfaces, via statistical displays, to graphical games. In this chapter I will give a first introduction to using graphics in Python, using turtles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turtles were originally designed to introduce children to light computer programming, and as such they are a really basic introduction to using computer graphics. But Python supports them by default, so you do not need to install any third-party modules. Although turtle graphics are not very useful, they might be enjoyable to play around with a bit. \"Serious graphics\" will be discussed in later chapters."

However, each side of the triangle is drawn as follows: you draw one-third of the side, then you turn left 60 degrees, draw one-third of the side, turn right 120 degrees, draw one-third of the side, turn left 60 degrees, and draw the final one-third of the side. I.e., the side consists of a line with a smaller triangle sticking out of it. Now, for each of those \"one-third of a side\"s you are going to do the same thing: draw one-third, turn, draw one-third, etcetera. And you can go to further depths doing that. So drawing the side of the triangle becomes a recursive call to drawing smaller and smaller sides. You can easily draw a Koch snowflake using turtle graphics. Do so (of course, you can only do it to a limited depth; depth more than 3 will be really slow)."

# This function solves a quadratic equation.
# Its parameters are the numeric values for A, B, and C in the 
# equation Ax**2 + Bx + C = 0. It returns three values: an int 
# 0, 1, or 2, indicating the number of solutions, followed by two 
# numbers which are the solutions. With no solutions, both 
# solutions are set to zero. With one solution, it is returned as 
# the first of the two, while the other is set to zero.
